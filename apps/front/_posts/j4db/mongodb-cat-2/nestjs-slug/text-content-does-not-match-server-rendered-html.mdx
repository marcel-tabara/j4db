Text content does not match server-rendered HTML
Why This Error Occurred
While rendering your application, there was a difference between the React tree that was pre-rendered from the server and the React tree that was rendered during the first render in the browser (hydration).

Hydration is when React converts the pre-rendered HTML from the server into a fully interactive application by attaching event handlers.

Common Causes
Hydration errors can occur from:

Incorrect nesting of HTML tags
<p> [nested](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error) in another <p> tag
<div> nested in a <p> tag
Interactive Content cannot be nested (<a> nested in a <a> tag, <button> nested in a <button> tag, etc)
Using checks like typeof window !== 'undefined' in your rendering logic
Using browser-only APIs like window or localStorage in your rendering logic
Browser extensions modifying the HTML
Incorrectly configured CSS-in-JS libraries
Ensure your code is following our official examples
Incorrectly configured Edge/CDN that attempts to modify the html response, such as Cloudflare Auto Minify
